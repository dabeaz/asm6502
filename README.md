# asm6502

A small 6502 assembler written in Python.  This was part of the
[Superboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB2t6xG2RzE) talk I gave
at PyCon'2011.  More details [here](http://dabeaz.blogspot.com/2011/03/superboard-takes-pycon.html).
I never really put that code anywhere official, but here it is for
your own amusement. -- Dave
